## About this hands-on workshop

This case-study involves taking a set of predefined requirements for a medical device (Ventilator & Humidication system) and modifying and linking them to a new system architecture in System Composer. Various features of System Composer will be explored ranging from requirements decomposition to trade study analysis, implementation in Simulink, and reporting. The methodology used by this workshop is Requirements, Functional, Logical, Physical (RFLP) but System Composer can support many different methodologies through the use of profiles and stereotypes.
